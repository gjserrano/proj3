			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A1: In a few paragraphs, describe the existing code for locating the
>> frame, if any, that contains the data of a given page.

Every page is a struct that holds data and pointers, such as a frame struct that has a pointer locating the kernel virtual address that contains its data and a page owner reference. A page is created NULL and gets a frame by using the frame_alloc_and_lock() method. When the system is looking for a free frame, it uses frame_alloc_and_lock() to find one, which it keeps trying to get memory for a new frame allocation, and if no sizeable memory is available, then it creates room by getting rid of an existing frame, and is then returned with data for the associated page, unless it cannot get rid of a frame, then it cancels the new frame creation.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A2: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

It is not possible to do two processes at one time, as scan_lock prevents multiple, and every frme contains a lock stating if occupied, so two processes cannot get the same frame ever.

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B1: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe the algorithm used to choose a frame to evict.

We used Least Recently Used (LRU) to determine which frame to evict. This algorithm looks for the frame that hasn't been recently used, then it evicts that frame. The frames are iterated over twice to see find the least recently used, if all have been used NULL is returned.

>> B2: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

There are two important steps before a frame can be allocated.
First, the address of the frame must be within the allocated stack space.
Second, the page address must be with 32 bytes of the threads user_esp.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

N/A

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

Each mapping holds a reference to the file it's mapping and the address in memory. Each thread contains a list of the files mapped to that thread. Otherwise, the pages containing memory mapped file information are managed just the same as any other page.

The page fault and eviction process differs slightly for pages belonging to memory mapped files. Non-file related pages are moved to a swap partition upon eviction, regardless of whether or not the page is dirty. When evicted, Memory mapped file pages must only be written back to the file if modified. Otherwise, no writing is necessary.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

Pages for a new file mapping are only allocated if pages are found that are free and unmapped.
The program refuses to allocate already occupied space. If a file attempts to do so, it's unmapped and the program fails.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.

Our code shares the code for the two situations. All pages will eventually be paged out. The only difference is a check to see whether or not the page should be written back out to disk. If the page is marked as private then it should be swapped to the swap partition, otherwise it should be written out to the file on disk.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

This was one of the easier projects for us, as the topics were very interesting and provided a good base to understand and figure out more about pages and tables.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

Not any particular part of the project provided more, mainly just the base reading and understanding of what the base code provided provided the most insight.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

No, this project seems very straight forward and has enough base code provided to gain a better understanding of the topics being worked on in project 3.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

No, the TA's were great for us when we needed help for this project.

>> Any other comments?
